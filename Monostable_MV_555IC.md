# Monostable multivibrator using 555 timer IC .

## Given Qustion

#### Generating the waveforms with the pulse width of 0.5ms using 555 Timer IC. 


## Some infomation about the 555 Timer IC  
This 555 Timer IC is one of the most widely used integrated circuits in electronics,This IC can be commonly used to produce accurate time delays, oscillations It operates based on charging and discharging a capacitor through resistors, controlled by internal comparators and a flip-flop.

The 555 Timer can operate in three major modes
### 1. Monostable Mode 
It will generates a single output pulse when triggeredand also the duration of the pulse is set by a resistor and capacitor.  
and also the pulse width formula is given by
#### Pulse Width (T) = 1.1*R*C

### 2. Astable Mode -
It produces a continuous square wave without any external triggering. 
and the formula is given by 
#### T = (R1+R2)*C while charging the capacitor 

#### T = R2*C while discharging of the capacitor  

### 3. Bistable Mode 
Works like a basic set-reset latch.
One input triggers it ON, another turns it OFF.
