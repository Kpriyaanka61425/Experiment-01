DIFFERENTIAL AMPLIFIER CIRCUITS

- A differential amplifier is a type of electronic amplifier that amplifies  
 the difference between two input signals and suppresses any signal that is 
 common ON both inputs.This feature makes it highly effective in eliminating 
 noise and interference.It is the fundamental building block of many analog 
 circuits and forms the input stage of most operational amplifiers (op-amps).  

- IMPORTANCE OF DIFFERENTIAL AMPLIFIERS 

- Noise Reduction: By rejecting common-mode noise, they improve signal integrity.
- High Accuracy and Stability: Used in precision measurement and control systems.
- Essential in Op-Amp Design: The core component in operational amplifiers and
  instrumentation amplifiers.
- Wide Range of Applications: Found in communication systems, biomedical devices, 
  and industrial sensors.

- Basic Circuit Configuration  

  A simple differential amplifier consists of two transistors (BJT or MOSFET) with 
  their emitters or sources connected together, sharing a common current source.The 
  differential output can be taken either single-ended or as a fully differential signal.
