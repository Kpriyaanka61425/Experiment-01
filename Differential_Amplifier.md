EXPERIMENT -03  

A differential amplifier is a type of electronic amplifier that amplifies  
the difference between two input signals and suppresses any signal that is common ON both inputs.  
This feature makes it highly effective in eliminating noise and interference.  
It is the fundamental building block of many analog circuits and forms the input stage of most operational amplifiers (op-amps).
